                <h3 a href="#about-me"><strong>About Me</strong>
                <!--I want all of this in a box--><p id="about-me-paragraph">I suppose I should start at the beginning of my career life...When I was 8 I had this lemonade stand...HA just kidding. I won't go back THAT far.</p>
            
                <p>Let's start at around 2009 when I entered the restaurant and bar industry at 19 with stars in my eyes and no back pain yet. <br> Fast foward to 2011, I now hold a management position at the same restaurant, but I'm always tired, I never have time off and I see my family less and less.</p>
            
                <p>Now lets jump to 2020. I'm still managing a restaurant and bar owned by the same chain...and I'm absolutely miserable.</p>
           
                <p>I was desperately searching for a career that would allow me to have the lifestyle I'd wanted since I became an adult and realized that world travel IS indeed possible and increasingly achievable. I knew I would never be able to have that lifestyle and keep the career I was currently employed in, so I started doing research. I discovered something called 'Full-Stack Development'. The more I looked into it, the more fascinated I became. Not just because it was the answer to my travelling prayers, but because I began to become curious, I'd always wondered about the industry and had always felt deep respect for those who chose this career path, because it just seemed so complicated and I definitely didn't have the kind of confidence in my capabilities to attempt to learn this kind of thing. Then one day it just hit me how much time I DON'T have. I pinched my nose, took a gigantic leap of faith in myself and canon-balled my way into a course at The University of Texas.</p>

                <p>As you can see, I haven't drowned yet, but I've got a long way to go. I look forward to the life-long journey of continuing my education in this field and creating as much as I can to expand my experience and skills.</p>
